# Machine Learning Weather Forecasting Project

This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to improve weather forecasting. By analyzing large datasets and applying advanced algorithms, the goal is to enhance the accuracy of weather predictions. A publicly available weather dataset that includes various meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation is used for the training of the model. The dataset is collected from multiple weather stations over a specific time period.
